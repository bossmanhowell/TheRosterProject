Welcome! \n

This is a place dedicated to the ever ending endeavor of dating in NYC. \n

We shall analyze the actions, words, and attributes of both women and men as one man -- me -- attempts to date and build relationships with women of NYC. \n

Hope you enjoy! \n

P.S. -- To be honest, this is more for me to keep track of all the random shit that happens! \n


The Roster: (This is a list of the women who currently hold my interest and intent. They are in order of which we met -- or matched.\n

NickName          Something interesting \n
Krissy            Sends me biology snapchats of her putting shit under her own microscope. \n
Nola Goddess      Must lead when dancing -- cute at first, but kinda annoying on the turns.  \n       
Giggles           Always wears one of those HUGE Canadian jackets; I still don't get those. People you ARE NOT in the Artic. \n
Auburn            From Alabama, but unfortunately an Auburn fan...           \n
Perfect           Best friend of a weird hookup buddy of mine? #recipefordisaster \n
