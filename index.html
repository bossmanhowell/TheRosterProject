<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>This is a place dedicated to the ever ending endeavor of dating in NYC. </p>

<p>We shall analyze the actions, words, and attributes of both women and men as one man -- me -- attempts to date and build relationships with women of NYC. </p>

<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>P.S. -- To be honest, this is more for me to keep track of all the random shit that happens! </p>
